      "\n\n## Introducing Next.js\nNext.js continues to be considered a “win” amongst a number of developers everywhere. (If you couldn't guess, I am one of them!) To help shine light on some of the reasons why I love the framework, I dediced to put together a series of posts on the topic. In this first one, I'm going to cut right to the chase and shed light on a few of the amazing things that Next.js makes possible.\n\n\n### Ease of Use\n\nAnyone who has used the technology will tell you how easy it is to get started building a project with Next.js. You can have an app running as quickly as you’re computer can install the required packages... seriously.\n\nBelow is all that’s needed to create the shell for an app.\n\n![npm install next ex](/static/install-next-ss.png)\n\nGranted that you’re package.json’s `script`'s object has been [modified correctly](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#setup), you can paste the code below into the `pages/index.js`, run `npm run dev` and watch you’re application come to life.\n\n```javascript\n\nimport React from 'react';\nexport default ({title = 'How tight is this next.js thing?'}) => <h2>{title}</h2>;\n\n```\n\n`pages` acts as our router in Next.js. If we added the same code toa new file named `pages/about.js` and then visited `localhost:3000/about`, we'll see that our component is displayed and Next.js took care of the routing for us! Now let's continue on to some more cool stuff.\n\n\n### Automatic Code Splitting\n\nAny programmer in the now will tell you how important code splitting is to ensure an application’s performance is optimal. As it’s name suggests, code splitting allows us to *split* our application code up into a series of lightweight bundles. Instead of loading all of our JavaScript, our application will only load the bundle needed. Webpack is the tool most associated with this process. Instead of having to configure webpack to perform this, we can rely on Next.js! Let' get a better understanding of how this is accomplished so we can better understand what's going on. \n\nBelow shows an example of the `.next` directory created from running `next build`. \n\n\n\nBy taking a look at the [projects repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/v3-beta/examples), you will see a slew of examples with frameworks like Express, Koa, and Hapi, further showing how extendable Next.js truly is. Next.js simply provides all of these amazing benefits and let’s the developer pick and choose how they want to harnesss them. \n\n### HMR and Error Reporting\nThe effectiveness of Hot-module replacement (HMR) has made it a must-have during development. Instead of reloading an entire application when code is changed, HMR will only recreate modules that have been altered. Webpack’s homepage describes the practice as “Livereload for every module” so as you can image, this allows next.js to come equipped with a high-powered development process but it doesn’t stop there. Users will quickly learn about the amazing error messages that Next.js immediately renders to the browser whenever code is in correct. \n\nYes, you’ve heard that correct. I said “amazing error messages”. Surely I must be crazy. Well, take a look for yourself. I’ve recorded a quick clip of this in action. \n\n\nAt first we see the application being rendered correctly in the browser. To demonstrate Next.js’ ability then see an error as a result of me removing the `>` symbol from my JSX. No matter how small, these errors can cause serious headaches due to all sorts of nonsense so I thought this provided a good example of Next.js instantly picking up the error and it doesn’t stop pinpoints the file and even the line on which this error is occurring thus making tracking down bugs a breeze. Every developer knows the struggle of spending more time than they’d be willing to admit on finding a bug, only to find out that the issue was embarrassingly trivial. Next.js eliminates this problem and thus allows developers to work with great efficiency. \n\n> \"So do you agree? Am I everything you want in an error message and more?\"\n> - \"Next.js\" via localhost:3000 | 8/26/2016\n\n### Final thoughts\nHopefully by now you’re beginning to realize how powerful of a framework Zeit has created with Next.js. In my next post, i'm going to dive deeper into Next.js and in particular, my experiences working it. In the meantime, I highly recommend you checking out yet another home-run that Zeit has released to the people! \n\n##### Additional Resources\n* [Next.js Repo](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)\n* [Learn Next.js -- Awesome for beginners!!!](learnnextjs.com)\n* [Zeit Blog - Next.js 3](https://zeit.co/blog/next3)\n* [Zeit Slack](https://zeit.chat/)\n* [awesome-nextjs](https://github.com/unicodeveloper/awesome-nextjs)\n",

      "\n\n### Understanding Outcomes with Pure Components \nUse of Stateless Functional Components (a.k.a. “pure” or “dumb” components) in ReactJS continues to grow since first being released in React 0.14, and for good reason. By relying on pure components, developers end up writing reusable code thats extremely easy to test, thus leading to better application architecture. Why?\nA functional stateless component is merely a factory function used to create a react component. Personally, I like the term “pure component” because its indicative of what the code really is — a pure function sprinkled with some JSX.\n\n> \"A pure function is a function which:\nGiven the same input, will always return the same output.\nProduces no side effects.\nRelies on no external mutable state.\" </br>\n>  Eric Elliott, Master the JavaScript interview: [What is a Pure Function](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/master-the-javascript-interview-what-is-a-pure-function-d1c076bec976)\n\nEquipped with the right amount of tests, the use of pure functions can help bring peace of mind to developers by ensuring that any scenario which was tested will not have an unintended result in the application. As you can image, this can go along way when building large scale applications. It should also come as no surprise to know that pure functions are the heart of Redux which relies on JavaScript’s `reduce` function. \n\nIn an upcoming post, i’ll go into further detail on how reduce works. For now, I want to continue on with the idea of writing “bullet-proof” React components using pure functions. To best illustrate this, i’m going to show some code that shows a react child component.\n\n```javascript\n// Post.js\nconst Post = ({ title, content }) => \n  <div className=\"post\">\n    <h2>{title}</h2>\n    <p>{content}</p>\n  </div>;\n```\n\nThe clean nature of these components make it extremely easy to reason about the code. In this case, we see the that `Post` is just a function that takes title and content `props` and produces an element. Usually, you may see `props` but i’ve utilized ES6 destructuring. By doing so, my we’re able to pull specific values out of the `props` object and access `props.title` and `props.content` without using [dot notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors). \n\nPersonally, I think that this is awesome as it removes any mystery about the `props` being passed into a component. In programming, mystery is never good a thing so this allows us to read code than others can more easily reason about, especially as components become more large!\n\nAlthough this code may not look like much, it could very well play an integral part of an application. For instance, let's imagine this `<Post/>` component renders articles in an application that has over a million daily users. If that's the case, then we will likely rather these smaller, cohesive blocks of code as they allow us to hammer out every last detail! **If we can think of the scenario, we can test how our pure component will react**. \n\nDevelopers often get discouraged when writing unit tests as their not sure what to test for. As we learned, the use of pure compoents provide us with everything we need to know in order to write effective tests. In this instance, we know that `<Post />` takes a `title` and a `content` prop. \n\n```javascript\n// Post.test.js\nimport test from 'tape';\nimport dom from 'cheerio';\nimport Post from './Post';\nimport { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom';\n\ntest('<Post /> ', assert => {\n  const msg = 'should render a post with a title and content';\n  // define preexisiting conditions\n  const props = {\n      title: 'I am the title',\n      content: 'I am the content!!!!!! Woooooooo!'\n  };\n  const checkProps = RegExp(props);\n\n  const el = <Post {props} />\n  const $ = dom.load(render(el));\n  const output = $('post').html();\n\n  const actual = checkProps.test(output);\n  const expected = true;\n\n  assert.same(actual, expected, same);\n  assert.end()\n})\n```\n\nDevelopers often get discouraged when writing unit tests as their not sure what to test for. As we learned, the use of pure compoents provide us with everything we need to know in order to write effective tests. \n\n\n### Step 1 - Set up pre-existing conditions\nIn this instance, we know that `<Post />` takes a `title` and a `content` prop which was see being assigned inside of our `test()` right below the `msg` variable. Following this, we can use `Regex` to create a variabe that contains these props. By doing this, we will be able to use `Regexp`s `test` function to see if our `Post` component contains these values. \n\n```javascript\n// post.test.js\nconst props = {\n    title: 'I am the title',\n    content: 'I am the content!!!!!! Woooooooo!'\n};\nconst checkProps = RegExp(props);\n```\n\n### Step 2 - Render the HTML from `<div class=\"post\">` \nFollowing this, we then see the use of cheerio to render our component. Cheerio allows us to traverse and manipulate the DOM using its API. Like many developers, I utilize server side rendering quite often and the nature of Cheerio makes it a fantstic choice. That said, we can use cheerio's `.load` method to render our react element. From there, we simply pass in the selector of the contents which we want to check. In our case, it's the `.post` class.  \n\n```javascript\n // Set up cheerio\n const el = <Post {props} />\n const $ = dom.load(render(el));\n const output = $('post').html();\n```\n\n#### Step 3 - Test the props\nThe last thing we need to do is check the props of our `output` variabe. To do this, we have an `actual` value which will check to see if our component passes our `checkProps` test. If it does, that means the `actual` value will return `true` and give us a passing test! \n\n```javascript\nconst actual = checkProps.test(output);\nconst expected = true;\n\nassert.same(actual, expected, msg);\nassert.end();\n```",
